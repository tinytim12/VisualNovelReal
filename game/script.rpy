    n "Okay, maybe I gotta introduce myself first."
    
    n "My name is Zack, and I've just seventeen years old, halfway through high school." 
    
    n "Everyday I leave my house at eight o clock, catch the morning train and arrive only slightly late."
    
    n "My main subjects are Maths, Chemistry, and Physics."
    
    n "I listen to lectures for eight hours before I'm finally let off."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "Sounds boring, doesn't it?"
    
    n "I'm sure if someone were to read a script of my life, he would fall asleep of boredom before the very end."
    
    n "But don't worry! The story's about to get interesting."
    
    n "I'm not going to be an ordinary high school student for the rest of my life! "
    
    n "Unlike my classmates, I'm always looking for interesting things to do. I'm not scared of treading off the beaten path."

    n "The other day, I stole a pencil from my teacher's desk when he wasn't looking."

    n "Okay, maybe that sounds a little lame. But I'm trying."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "But right now, any viewers tuning in are in for a treat."
    
    n "No joke, my hearts pumping like crazy and I can't stop squeezing my fingers."
    
    n "Because, just two meters away from me, sitting on the next bench over, is her."
    
    n "Staring at something in the distance, past the barriers and through the apartment buildings that surround the station."
    
    n "Most people, when waiting for the train, would just keep their head down and stare into their phone, no?"
    
    n "But she's always like this, when she's resting. Just examining something that the rest of us can't fathom to see."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "Okay, I probably sound like a stalker, but hear me out."
    
    n "It's not like I tracked her every move - but in a fancy school like mine, where everyone followed each other and no one stepped out of line..."
    
    n "It was impossible for her not to stand out."
    
    n "Most people moved around in groups, blending in with their banter and smiles, swinging their arms and telling jokes, always knee deep in the swing of things."
    
    n "But her? She wasn't concerned with anything like that."
    
    n "Her childish dress style, for one, stuck out like a sore thumb."
    
    n "Often, you could see her sitting alone at the cafeteria, sipping from a modest fruit juice packet, simply observing the world around her."
    
    n "Other times, she would carry this huge notebook around with her, and would spend a whole half hour in the same spot with her head bent down, scribbling something down for only her to see."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "What was in that sketchbook?"
    
    n "That was one of the many questions I found swimming in my head when I caught sight of her."
    
    n "But most importantly, I wanted to know how she did it."
    
    n "How she managed to detach herself from the flow, and still remain calm about herself."
    
    n "The flow was a strange thing. When I started high school, I was swept up before I even realized it."
    
    n "Laughing at lame jokes, patting shoulders of people I didn't like."
    
    n "I even forced myself to learn soccer, just because all the other strong looking boys played."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "But her? She had it all figured out, you could tell."
    
    n "I wanted to know her secret."
    
    n "In fact, I wanted to know everything about her."
    
    n "Now that I think about it, this is pretty much a confession of my feelings."
    
    n "Yeah, there's not denying it."
    
    n "I've fallen in love with her."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "But, how do you even talk to girls?"
    
    n "That's something they never teach you in school."
    
    n "I know her, but I'm not sure if she knows me."
    
    n "If a random stranger suddenly comes up and tries to talk to you, wouldn't be weird as hell?"
    
    n "If it were me, and I was a girl...yeah, pretty sure I would be running for the nearest exit."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "Okay. So what I need is some sort of excuse."
    
    n "..."
    
    n "Maybe I could drop my pen near me and pretend that it's hers..."
    
    n "..."
    
    n "Then how do I continue the conversation from there?!"
    
    n "I don't even know her name!"
    
    *train comes*
    
    n "Damn the train's coming!"
    
    n "I don't know which station she gets off."
    
    n "It could be a long journey, or she could be gone by next stop."
    
    n "No, never mind that, she's already moving inside."
    
    n "I have to follow her..."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "...The train's empty."
    
    n "It's in the middle of the afternoon, after all, and all the adults are away."
    
    n "That means, of course, that I have to stand far away from her so I don't look weird."
    
    n "I was close to her when we entered the train, together, though."
    
    n "...she smelled nice."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "This is driving me crazy."
    
    n "As the distance to the next station nears, my anxiety keeps shooting up."
    
    n "This is the only chance I have."
    
    n "Her existence is like a dandelion in the wind - no, that's not entirely accurate."
    
    n "She's more like a lily in a pond."
    
    n "Always in the distance, but out of reach."
    
    n "It's only in this train when she's within my grasp."
    
    n "There's no time to think. No point in playing what might happen. I have to do it now or lose it forever."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "So... I stand up, and approach her."
    
    #approach alexis
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "Oh shit..."
    
    n "Why does she look like I'm about to rob her?"
    
    n "I don't have any kind of creepy smile on my face, right?!"
    
    a "..."
    
    n "Damn, say something!" 
    
    n "Something, anything!"
